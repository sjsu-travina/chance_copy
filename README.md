## Timeline

4/25  Incorporate clickable files and an asset file to a repository for images. Begin adjusting the repository by rearranging where the clickable images will be.

4/26 Start creating a ‘Title page’, ‘Level page’, and ‘Game Over’ page. Remember to place the clickable actions in the ‘Level page’ and a button to restart the game.

4/27  Create a code in order to make a playable and functional game. Only use shapes (rectangles or ellipses) at the moment so I can have my full attention on the functionality of the game before making an art style for the game.

4/28 Continue to create a code for the game to be functional.

4/29 Check back with the game and debug and test the software in order for the game to run smoothly.

4/30 Create an aesthetic for the game: Create art style for characters and change colors for the game.

5/1 Do some finishing touches. Add or remove any unwanted coding or art.
